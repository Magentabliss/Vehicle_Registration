**Vehicle Registration App – Backend Development (Java)**
Developed the backend of a **Vehicle Registration Application** using **Java**. The system allows users to input and manage vehicle details, including **brand, model, mileage, year of production, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)**, and **number plate**. The implementation utilizes **Java constructors**, **ArrayLists**, and the **Scanner** class to handle data input, storage, and management efficiently.

Key contributions:

* Designed and implemented core data structures for vehicle information management.
* Applied object-oriented programming principles to ensure scalability and maintainability.
* Enabled user interaction through console-based input for dynamic data handling.
